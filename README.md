# seismic multiplets scan routine

The repository contains:

* The originally written *mathematica code notebook* (mathematica_code.nb).This is the software complete with all features and an interactive GUI. The notebook can run on in a licensed Wolfram Mathematica environment (https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica) or in the Wolfram Player Pro (https://www.wolfram.com/player-pro/), the commercial paid version with I/O enabled.

* the *python porting of the catalog scanning routine core algorithm, added in two formats: 
   * pure python code (python_code.py).
   * the Colab ipython version (multiplets_core_colab.ipynb)
 The code has been checked to behave exactly as the mathematica code. No GUI programming is anyway present: I/O is actually based on disk files read-write. Any user interface can be easily added by experienced Python programmers. 

* an *example catalog file* for the python code testing (Simulated_100k_005-02-2_geo.txt.zip). It is in the format needed by the software importer. 

* other not strictly necessary files have been added for more information: they are generated by the python code itself on the example catalog and are present for reference only.

Since the regular mathematica notebook cannot be run without some sort of license, a CDF file (https://www.wolfram.com/cdf/) has also been included. This file is a fully working GUI of the software in which I/O operations are disabled and catalog data is fixed and hardcoded in the CDF. It can be used freely with the CDF player from Wolfram. They provide the same functionality of the regular notebook and is provided for GUI demonstration.

The python code uses some classes that must be installed in the local environment, the file environment.yml is the Conda description export of the environment under which the software actually runs. It can be useful to build the same environment on the reader local machine using Conda.

In the .py and .ipynb files all file names are hard-coded in the program itself. They have no assigned path therefore the python interpreter expects to find them in the same directory were the program is. If needed user can be edit these lines to point to some other preferred user paths. Furthermore parameters setting i.e. magniture threshold and magnitude differences are specified in the code too and need to be edited to change those parameters too. THe same is true for the Gardner & Knopoff function defined as lists in the code.

The jupyter version should follow the same prescriptions of the python IDE if it is run locally. However, in the web IDE version of Google Colab, user could need extra disk space and should connect the web IDE to the corresponding (same user) Google Drive space. In the code there is a cell written to the purpose, but the procedure is anyway well documented in the Google environment.

As a last add-on a reproducible () generated yaml file has been added to give informations on the actual working environment under which the file runs (see also the Conda environment file described above).

The code is open source, not maintained and hopefully "citation-ware" i.e. it can be used completely free, and a citation to the author is more than welcome.
